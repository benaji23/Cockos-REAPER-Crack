- Lightning-Fast Performance
REAPER runs quickly on almost any machine. It doesn't require high-end specs, which makes it perfect for mobile setups or older systems. Despite its small size, it handles complex projects with ease.

- Unmatched Customization
From custom themes to personalized workflows, REAPER is made for those who want full control. You can create macros, use Lua scripting, or tweak menus and toolbars to suit your needs.

- Extensive Plugin Support
REAPER supports VST, VST3, AU, and JSFX plugin formats. You can use third-party plugins or tap into REAPER’s built-in suite of audio effects and virtual instruments.

- Frequent Updates
Cockos listens to user feedback and rolls out frequent updates. These updates are lightweight, fast, and usually packed with valuable improvements.

- Flexible Licensing
REAPER’s licensing is refreshingly honest. You can use the full-featured version for 60 days free—no feature limits. After that, you can buy a discounted personal license or a commercial license, depending on your needs. Either way, the pricing is affordable.
